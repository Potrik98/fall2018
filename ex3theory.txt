- A Tree contains at least one value (Leaf node)
so we do not have to return a maybe.

- Because they are applicable to any Foldable t,
including both Foldable [] and Foldable Tree

- (<=) returns a Bool but because complex numbers
are of higher dimensionality than real numbers,
it does not make sense to say one number is 'bigger'.

- The answer returned is 1-3i which is correct.
This is because z - w is implemented as z + (neg w)

- No, because T can not be a synonym.

- Multiple declaration error.
The type is a function, e.g studentnr :: Student -> Int,
and thus cannot have mutiple declarations.
